            interior of a building to achieve a healthier and more aesthetically pleasing environment for the people

              enhancement projects. Interior design is a multifaceted profession that includes conceptual development,
               space planning, site inspections, programming, research, communicating with the stakeholders of a

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">There are a wide range of working conditions and employment 
            opportunities within interior design. Large and tiny corporations often hire interior designers as
             employees on regular working hours. Designers for smaller firms and online renovation platforms 
             usually work on a contract or per-job basis. 
            In some cases, licensed professionals review the work and sign it before submitting the design for
             approval by clients or construction permisioning. The need for licensed review and signature varies
              by locality, relevant legislation, and scope of work. Their work can involve significant travel to
               visit different locations.
